# ADM-HW1
Repository for 1st ADM-Homework .

In this repositoy I attached 2 files:
1)"scripts.py" where I put all the scripts of HackerRank exercises;
2)"stamps.pdf" that contain a merged pdf file of screenshot from HackerRank submission, divided by category of exercise.

Generally speaking, coming from an economics background without good programming skills, for me was not easy complete this homework.
I tried to learn as much as possible looking on YouTube tutorials and "W3School" documentation.
I had many issues on RegEx exercises, in particular to understand the meaning of the pattern:in fact regex is the challange that I have completed less.
On the .py script I've specified some particular exercise where I ask to collegues or YouTube to complete them, each time trying to understand and make my sense of the code.
