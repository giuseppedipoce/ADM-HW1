# ADM-HW1
Repository for 1st ADM-Homework .

In this repositoy I attached 2 files:
1)"scripts.py" where I put all the scripts of HackerRank exercises and challanges;
2)"stamps.pdf" that contain a merged pdf file of screenshot from HackerRank submission, sorted by challanges.

In the #comments on the script are specified the exercises in which I needed youtube help or to discuss with my colleagues. In general I had problems with regex, in fact it is the challange I completed the least. In particular I found it difficult to understand the logic of the various patterns in the proposed exercises.
